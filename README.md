# Sentinel - fork of ConfigServer Firewall & Security

âš¡ The sudden shutdown of Configserver in 2025 has left a huge gap in our ecosystem. For years, ConfigServer Firewall (CSF) has been the backbone of server security for hosting providers and control panels â€”stable, feature-rich, and trusted by sysadmins everywhere.

Luckily, *Way to the Web Limited* released the CSF script under the [GPL license](LICENSE.txt).

Soon after, a group of us SysAdmins have started Sentinel project â€” a fork of CSF that will be actively maintained, community-driven, and fully compatible as a drop-in replacement for existing servers.

ðŸ”§ The mission:
* Keep the features that made CSF indispensable
* Actively patch, improve, and adapt it to modern needs
* Build a sustainable, open project for the community

If youâ€™ve relied on CSF in your day-to-day work, this is your chance to shape its future. Weâ€™re looking for developers, testers, sysadmins, writers, designers â€” anyone passionate about keeping servers secure.

ðŸ‘‰ Letâ€™s make sure the tool weâ€™ve all depended on doesnâ€™t fade away. Join us in building Sentinel and carry CSFâ€™s legacy forward.
