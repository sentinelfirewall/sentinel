# Sentinel - fork of ConfigServer Firewall & Security

⚡ The sudden shutdown of Configserver in 2025 has left a huge gap in our ecosystem. For years, ConfigServer Firewall (CSF) has been the backbone of server security for hosting providers and control panels —stable, feature-rich, and trusted by sysadmins everywhere.

Luckily, *Way to the Web Limited* released the CSF script under the [GPL license](LICENSE.txt).

Soon after, a group of us [SysAdmins](https://github.com/orgs/sentinelfirewall/people) have started Sentinel project — a fork of CSF that is actively maintained, community-driven, and fully compatible as a drop-in replacement for existing servers.

🔧 The mission:
* Keep the features that made CSF indispensable
* Actively patch, improve, and adapt it to modern needs (ipsets to nfset, iptbales to nftables..)
* Build a sustainable, open project for the community

If you’ve relied on CSF in your day-to-day work, this is your chance to shape its future. We’re looking for developers, testers, sysadmins, writers, designers — anyone passionate about keeping servers secure.

👉 Let’s make sure the tool we’ve all depended on doesn’t fade away. Join us in building Sentinel and carry CSF’s legacy forward.
